# Whiskey-webscraper

## About project
____________________________________________________________

This is a crawler and scraper for whiskey from https://www.whiskybase.com/, which is designed to monitor changes in the price of bottles, recording in the changes in the database so we can display a graph of the price change of an individual bottle.
Ultimately, we want to create a user-friendly system for the user that allows automation (and maybe in the future some ML for that).

The project was deployed on azure using github actions http://azure-whiskey-app.azurewebsites.net/
